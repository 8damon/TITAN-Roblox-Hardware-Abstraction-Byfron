## INTRODUCTION

> **ARES-RS** is a successor to the older C++ version of **TITAN-Spoofer**, RS implements many of the limitations of the C++ version, such as configurability, universal bootstrapper support, auto-updating & proper error handling and logging.

# OVERVIEW

ARES-RS is designed to protect your Main/Alt accounts from Byfron's account detection system's & Roblox's BanAsync component. To use this effectively, a VPN is heavily recomended.

For a much more detailed guide, join the **[Discord](https://hub.titansoftwork.com)** and read the guide provided.

## HOW IT WORKS

The Spoofer modifies HWID's (Hardware-Identifier's) to disrupt Roblox's systems.

More in-depth, the Spoofer adjusts to the way you configure it;

```toml
[runtime]
run_on_startup = true # uses scheduled-task
run_in_background = true # required for auto-spoofing
spoof_on_file_run = false # cannot be true when ``run_in_background`` is true
spoof_on_roblox_close = "silent" # OR ``notify``, notify will send a desktop notification

[spoofing]
clean_and_reinstall = true # remove roblox files & reinstall
spoof_connected_adapters = true # spoof Wi-Fi/Ethernet adapter you're connected to

[bootstrapper]
use_bootstrapper = true # using a bootstrapper?
path = 'C:\Users\Damon\AppData\Local\Bloxstrap\Bloxstrap.exe' # filepath to bootstrapper
custom_cli_flag = "" # if your bootstrapper uses a custom flag (default -player)
override_install = true # bootstrapper should be used to install roblox > web installer
open_roblox_after_spoof = false # after spoofing should open roblox app
```

The spoofer works by tracking when Roblox instances are open, once closed if ``spoof_on_roblox_close`` is ``true``, then it will run an automated spoof & notify depending on if its set to ``notify`` or ``silent``.

If ``spoof_on_roblox_close`` is ``false``, then the spoofer will only run when you run the ``aresrs.exe`` program.

For ``spoof_on_roblox_close`` to work, ``run_in_background`` must be ``true``, same applies to ``run_on_startup``.

## INSTALLATION

For prebuilt binaries (.exe's) you can find them in the **[ARES Discord](https://hub.titansoftwork.com)**.

*PDB's are provided.*

### COMPILING

I do not reccomend this unless you are a developer or a contributor

You will need the [rust programming language](https://rustup.rs).

Clone the repository;

```
git clone https://github.com/8damon/ARES-Spoofer.git
```

Enter it;

```
cd \ARES-Spoofer\
```

Build EXE + DLL;

```
cargo build --release --bin aresrs --lib
```

Find outputs in:

- ``target\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\release\aresrs.exe``
- ``target\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\release\ares.dll``

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- The Spoofer does NOT unban you from specific games OR on-site bans (Eg; Roblox website bans)

### DEVELOPER API / DLL USAGE (C ABI)

For DLL integration docs (exports, structs, callback usage, and call flow), see:

- [`DLL_API.md`](./DLL_API.md)

## SUPPORT

The Spoofer provides logs at ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\aresrs``, filter by modified-date & upload the relevant log file to said thread,

Open a support thread via the **[TITAN Discord](https://hub.titansoftwork.com)**.

## CONTRIBUTING

Contributions are welcome (bugfixes, refactors, docs, CI improvements).
